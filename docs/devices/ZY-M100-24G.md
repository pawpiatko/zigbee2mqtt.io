## Options
*[How to use device type specific configuration](../guide/configuration/devices-groups.md#specific-device-options)*

* `illuminance_lux_calibration`: Calibrates the illuminance_lux value (percentual offset), takes into effect on next report of device. The value must be a number.


## Exposes

### State (enum)
Presence state sensor.
Value can be found in the published state on the `state` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) or write (`/set`) this value.
The possible values are: `none`, `presence`, `move`.

### Presence (binary)

If value equals `true` presence is ON, if `false` OFF.

### Distance (numeric)
Target distance.
Value can be found in the published state on the `distance` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) or write (`/set`) this value.

### Illuminance (lux) (numeric)
Illuminance sensor.
Value can be found in the published state on the `illuminance_lux` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) or write (`/set`) this value.
The unit of this value is `lx`.

### Move sensitivity (numeric)
